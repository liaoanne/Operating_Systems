We think that it would be possible to modify Task 2 so that the number 
of philosophers can be changed randomly in the middle of the task. 
However, this would be a very involved task as there are many considerations 
that make it difficult to implement. 

For example, if we stop the threads in the middle of the task to add or 
remove philosophers, it could make the shared variable values unpredictable 
when the task resumes. As well, the Thread.stop method is depreciated so 
we would need to implement our own Thread. stop method. This would require 
that a thread consistently checks whether they have been removed or not. 
If they are removed, we would need to remove them from any waiting queues 
as well as notifyAll to release all of it's resources so deadlock does not occur.
